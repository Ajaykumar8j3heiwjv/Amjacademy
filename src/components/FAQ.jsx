      question: "What age groups do you teach?",
      answer:
        "I welcome students of all ages, from young children (4+) to adults. My teaching methods are adapted to suit each age group's learning style and attention span. For younger children, I use fun, interactive approaches with games and colorful materials, while older students can dive deeper into music theory and advanced techniques.",

    {
      question: "What instruments do you teach?",
      answer:
        "I specialize in piano, keyboard, and music theory fundamentals. I also provide guidance on basic music composition, sight-reading, and ear training. If you're interested in other instruments, I can help you build a strong musical foundation that will make learning any instrument easier.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer online classes?",
      answer:
        "Yes! I offer both in-person and online classes to accommodate different preferences and schedules.

    },
    {
      question: "How long are the lessons and how often should students take them?",
      answer:
        "Lesson duration varies by age and level: 30 minutes for young children (4-7 years), 45 minutes for intermediate students (8-12 years), and 60 minutes for advanced students and adults. I typically recommend weekly lessons for consistent progress, but we can adjust the frequency based on your goals and schedule.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your teaching experience?",
      answer:
        "I have over 7 years of dedicated music education experience, working with students of various ages and skill levels.

My approach combines traditional techniques with modern, engaging methods.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to have my own instrument to start lessons?",
      answer:
        "For piano lessons, you'll eventually need access to a piano or keyboard at home for practice. However, you don't need to purchase one immediately - I can provide guidance on renting or buying the right instrument for your budget and space. For the first few lessons, we can work with what's available in the studio.",
    },
    {
      question: "What materials or books will I need?",
      answer:
        "I provide most learning materials digitally, including sheet music, exercises, and theory worksheets. For structured learning, I may recommend specific method books based on your level and goals. I'll discuss any required materials during our first lesson and help you find the most cost-effective options.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you track student progress?",
      answer:
        "I maintain detailed progress records for each student, including skills mastered, areas for improvement, and practice recommendations. Students and parents receive regular feedback, and I provide periodic progress reports. We also set achievable goals and celebrate milestones to keep motivation high.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need to cancel or reschedule a lesson?",
      answer:
        "I understand that schedules can change! I ask for at least 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling. With adequate notice, we can reschedule your lesson for another available time slot. Emergency cancellations are handled on a case-by-case basis.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you prepare students for music exams or competitions?",
      answer:
        "I have experience preparing students for various music examinations, recitals, and competitions. I can help with technique refinement, performance preparation, music theory exams, and building confidence for public performances. We'll work together to set realistic goals and timelines.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your lesson rates and payment options?",
      answer:
        "Lesson rates vary based on duration and format (in-person vs. online). I offer flexible payment options including per-lesson payments, monthly packages, and semester plans. Contact me for current rates and to discuss the best payment plan for your situation. I believe quality music education should be accessible to everyone.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started with lessons?",
      answer:
        "Getting started is easy! Simply contact me through the website, phone, or email to schedule a consultation. During this initial meeting, we'll discuss your musical goals, assess your current level, and create a personalized learning plan. The first lesson can often serve as both an assessment and introduction to my teaching style.",
